### How it work ⚙️

> **Note**: 📝 There is **two part** of this **application** so if you're going to use this application than understanding the following things see down below.

1. As I mentioned above there is two part of this application, first is **FunBlog-Client** for **client-side** and second is **FunBlog-Server** for **server-side**. 
2. It's a server-side with is made on **NodeJS** and use **ReactJS** as a cient site. As for database, I used **MongoDB**. I'm used Replit for making this website. You can't run both client and server with one server on Replit. That why, I had separated both part.
